<b> <h2>  Purpose </h2> </b>
    
    <p>
The COVID-19 crisis has disrupted lives across our community. The impact of shelter in place orders, school and business closures, and health burdens are felt everywhere, and yet they are not felt everywhere in equal measure. Inspired by work like UCLA’s “Neighborhood Inequality in Shelter-in-Place Burden” and the King County, WA Equity Impact tool, and working in partnership with community organizers and leaders, we set out to understand the inequities of the pandemic in our own community. This is an initial attempt to create a Shelter-in-Place index of burden for the larger Charlottesville region to help decision makers, advocates, and residents better visualize the differential needs and experiences across our larger community.
    </p>
    <br>
<b> <h2> Indicators</h2> </b>
    
        The ability to shelter in place safely and comfortably, to practice social distancing effectively and freely, varies across space, mirroring pre-existing structural inequalities. To capture these variations, we identified a set of indicators representing access to space and resources and defining environments and constraints faced by residents. These include: </p>
    
   <ul>    
       <li> Population density: the number of people per square mile; higher density increases the odds of encountering others and the difficulty of social distancing.</li>
   <li> >1.5 People/room: the percent of households with more than 1.5 people per room, a common measure of overcrowding; overcrowding within a household increases the physical and psychological strain of sheltering in place and the risk of viral contagion.
       No car access: the percent of households without a vehicle; the absence of a car increases the burden of access to food, services, and other resources and serves as a barrier to stable employment.</li>
       <li>Children aged &lt; 6: the percent of families with children under 6 present; with schools and daycare closed, the presence of young children creates additional stressors on families as they seek to work, acquire resources in a risky environment, and maintain educational opportunities.</li>
       <li> No broadband: the percent of households without a broadband internet subscription; the absence of internet access is an obstacle to working from home, availability of information, educational opportunities, and entertainment making sheltering in place more comfortable.</li>
       <li> Low food access: percent of households without access to a nearby supermarket, within one mile for urban tracts and within 10 miles for rural tracts; the absence of nearby markets reduces the availability of food and related goods.</li>
    </ul>
    
Indicators are measured at the Census tract level, an area approximately the size of a neighborhood and containing between 2,000 and 8,000 people. Census tracts, however, still obscure important variation in the lived experiences of residents within these spaces.     <p>
        <br>
    <b> <h2> Additional Neighborhood Characteristics </h2> </b>

    <p> 
In addition to indicators for the burden of sheltering in place, we provide characteristics of each tract that shape the determinants of health.    </p>
 <ul> 
       <li>  Median household income: incorporating income in the last 12 months of all individuals 15 and older in the household, the median household income is the income threshold that divides households into two halves -- with half of the households below the value and half of the households above the value. </li>
 <li> Educational attainment: the percent of individuals 25 years or older with a Bachelors degree or more.</li>
 <li> Life expectancy: estimates of life expectancy at birth, the average number of years a person can expect to live. </li>
    </ul>  
    

        <br>
    <b> <h2>  Sources </h2> </b>
<p>  
Small-area population estimates are from the American Community Survey (ACS) 5-Year Estimates. Sent to approximately 3.5 million addresses per year, the 5-year survey estimates provide up-to-date estimates for localities that may be changing between censuses. As these are estimates derived from surveys, and not a full census, they are subject to variability due to sampling error. ACS measures and table sources: </p>
    
<ul> <li> Population density: Table B01003</li> 
<li> >1.5 People/room: B25014 </li> 
<li> No car access: B25044 </li> 
<li> Children aged &lt;6: B11003 </li> 
<li> No broadband: B28003 </li> 
<li> Median household income: S1901 </li> 
<li> Educational attainment: S1501 </li> 
    </ul>
    
    
    
<p>  
All indicators, except low food access and life expectancy, are taken directly from the 2014-2018 ACS.</p>

<ul> 
    <li> Low food access comes from the USDA Food Access Research Atlas, based on 2010-2014 American Community Survey data and 2015 Directory of Stores. </li>
    <li> Life expectancy estimates are from the U.S. Small-area Life Expectancy Estimates Project, estimating life expectancy at birth for the period 2010-2015.</li>
</ul>
    <br/>
 <b> <h2> Method </h2> </b>
<p>
To summarize the potentially compounding challenges generated by dense spaces, overcrowded homes, lack of access to a car, to broadband, to markets, and the presence of young children while working or sheltering at home, we summarize these indicators into a composite score or index.
</p>

<p> 
For the census tracts within our region, each measure is normalized to range between 0 and 1, with 1 representing the highest presence of burden -- the greatest density, the highest percent of household that are overcrowded, have no broadband subscription, no car, no nearby supermarket, and the highest percent of families with young children -- and 0 representing the least burden. These normalized scores for each measure are added to create the index, which can range from 0 to 6.
